<p>Alan Alexander Milne (18 January 1882 â€“ 31 January 1956) was an
English author, best known for his books about the teddy bear
Winnie-the-Pooh and for various children's poems. Milne was a noted
writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh
overshadowed all his previous work.</p>
