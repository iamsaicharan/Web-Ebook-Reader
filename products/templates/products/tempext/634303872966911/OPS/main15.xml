<p>Here the fourteenth Episode of the Book of Wonder endeth and
here the relating of the Chronicles of Little Adventures at the
Edge of the World. I take farewell of my readers. But it may be we
shall even meet again, for it is still to be told how the gnomes
robbed the fairies, and of the vengeance that the fairies took, and
how even the gods themselves were troubled thereby in their sleep;
and how the King of Ool insulted the troubadours, thinking himself
safe among his scores of archers and hundreds of halberdiers, and
how the troubadours stole to his towers by night, and under his
battlements by the light of the moon made that king ridiculous for
ever in song. But for this I must first return to the Edge of the
World. Behold, the caravans start.</p>
