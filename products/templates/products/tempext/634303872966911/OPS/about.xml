<div class="aboutauthor"><strong>About Lord Dunsany:</strong><br />
<p>Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany (24
July 1878 â€“ 25 October 1957) was an Anglo-Irish writer and
dramatist, notable for his work, mostly in fantasy, published under
the name Lord Dunsany. More than eighty books of his work were
published, and his oeuvre includes many hundreds of published short
stories, as well as successful plays, novels and essays. Born to
one of the oldest titles in the Irish peerage, Dunsany lived much
of his life at perhaps Ireland's longest-inhabited home, Dunsany
Castle near Tara, worked with W.B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, received
an honourary doctorate from Trinity College, was chess and
pistol-shooting champion of Ireland, and travelled and hunted
extensively. He died in Dublin after an attack of appendicitis.</p>
